**MLSG**    
1、Firstly, we propose a novel unified scheme to model the NER as a multi-label sequence generation task to overcome the exposure bias problem
caused by generating multiple entities sequentially in a sequence.  
2、Secondly, we avoid to generate the starting word of the entity and introduce the concept of part-entity to help the model learn the relationships
between words within entities.  
3、Thirdly, our proposed model reaches the SoTA level on 8 popular English datasets, including 2 planar NER datasets, 3 nested NER datasets and 3 discontiguous NER datasets
